# Laptop Price Prediction Project
## Summary

This project predicts laptop prices using machine learning techniques based on features such as company, type, specifications, and operating system. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training. Various regression algorithms are evaluated to determine the best-performing model for accurate price estimation.

## Description

The Laptop Price Prediction Project utilizes data science methodologies to forecast laptop prices accurately. It encompasses data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships. Feature engineering techniques enhance model performance by extracting valuable insights.

Multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and others, are employed and evaluated for their predictive capabilities. The best-performing model is then selected and deployed to provide real-time price predictions based on user input.

This project serves as a valuable tool for consumers, retailers, and manufacturers seeking reliable estimates of laptop prices tailored to specific requirements.
